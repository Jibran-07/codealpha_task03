Simple Banking Console Application

This Java program implements a basic console-based banking application. Users can choose to deposit funds, withdraw funds (with checks for insufficient balance), check their account balance, and exit the application. The code employs a menu-driven approach and utilizes a static variable to maintain the account balance.
